# Cobra
Windows process injection program that spoofs the parent process of your executable, and optionally injects DLL's into it.

Usage:
```
cobra.exe <target pid> <path to executable> [options]
        -d <path to dll>        Inject target dll into spoofed process
        -h                      Print help
```

Only use during legal activities. I take no responsibility for the misuse of this software.
